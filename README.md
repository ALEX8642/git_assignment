GitHub's issue function is a tool for tracking tasks, enhancements, pesky bugs, or other project-related items. 
## b. What is a _pull request_?
Pull requests are requests to merge changes from one branch into another, which allows for code review before integration/merge.
## c. Describe the steps to open a _pull request_?
1. Push changes to a branch.
2. Go to the repo on GitHub.
3. Click on "Pull Requests."
4. Click on "New Pull Request."
5. Select base and compare branches.
6. Add the title and description of the change.

## e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?
git is the local version control system. GitHub is a cloud-based service for hosting Git repos and team collaboration.
## f. What does `git diff` do?
Git diff shows the differences between file versions, commits, or branches. For example, typing git diff into your terminal while in the repo directory, will list in red and green any differences locally.
## g. What is the `main` branch?
This is the default branch for stable, production-ready code.
## h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?
No, we should use branches and pull requests to merge changes into main for better code management.
